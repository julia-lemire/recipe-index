## Architectural Decision Records

> **Organization**: Newest entries first (reverse chronological order)
> **Keep it concise**: 1 sentence per field (Decision/Rationale/Implementation)

#### Nov 18, 2025: Never Use BottomNavigation
- **Decision**: TopAppBar or NavigationDrawer only - BottomNavigation prohibited
- **Rationale**: Screen space critical for recipe content (ingredient lists, instructions, images)
- **Implementation**: Navigation rule added to ANDROID_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md with code examples

#### Nov 18, 2025: Offline-First Architecture with Local Storage Only
- **Decision**: Room database, no cloud sync, Samsung Quick Share for recipe sharing
- **Rationale**: User wants recipes available without internet, simplified privacy model
- **Implementation**: Room database for all entities, Quick Share integration for export/import

#### Nov 18, 2025: Manager Pattern for Complex Business Logic
- **Decision**: Business logic in `data/ContentManagers/`, ViewModels delegate to Managers
- **Rationale**: Keeps ViewModels thin (UI state only), enables reusable business logic, testable
- **Implementation**: RecipeManager, MealPlanManager handle all CRUD and business rules

#### Nov 18, 2025: StateFlow Over LiveData
- **Decision**: All observable state uses StateFlow, never LiveData
- **Rationale**: Modern coroutines-first approach, better Compose integration with `collectAsState()`
- **Implementation**: ViewModels expose `StateFlow<State>`, Settings classes use `MutableStateFlow`

#### Nov 18, 2025: Extract Components Proactively
- **Decision**: Extract when >50 lines, self-contained, or might be reused (not just 2+ uses)
- **Rationale**: Keeps files small from start, reduces need for future refactoring
- **Implementation**: Component extraction rule in ANDROID_DESIGN_PRINCIPLES.md

#### Nov 18, 2025: Hearth Design System
- **Decision**: Terracotta/clay tones (#E8997A, #2C1810), dark cards for browsing, light for cooking
- **Rationale**: Warm, home-kitchen aesthetic differentiates from clinical recipe apps
- **Implementation**: DESIGN_SYSTEM.md with complete Material 3 theme specification

#### Nov 18, 2025: Config Over Code Pattern
- **Decision**: User preferences in Settings classes with StateFlow, not hardcoded values
- **Rationale**: Enables runtime configuration changes, better testability, user customization
- **Implementation**: AppSettings class for global prefs, category-specific Settings where needed
